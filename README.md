# gxb2_battle_simulator

Battle simulator for GxB2.  
You'll need the original **COMPILED** code of the game to make the simulator work.

Currently we only need 4 directories: `app`, `base`, `data`, and `lib`.  
To create a soft link, for example: `ln -s <COMPILED CODE/src/app> <HERE/app>`

Principle: private use only and no distribution.

## Troubleshooting
Please refer to the [issues](https://github.com/afknst/gxb2_battle_simulator/issues) page.  
You can also post a new issue if people haven't mentioned the problem before.
